		"As you explore the surface, you may find little patches of ore samples from the Geolosys mod. By digging down from wherever you find these surface samples, you'll find vast deposits of that respective ore, ripe for the taking. Most of these samples and ores are under different names, but you can check what they actually are with the Field Guide."
