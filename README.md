# Welcome to Project Towny!
Modded Minecraft tends to be a rather solitary game. Because of the vast difference in technology and development between different players, it can be incredibly difficult to play with anyone but a group of close friends. No more!

Project Towny is a Minecraft modpack that intends to make nation building the standard. Work together to build infrastructure, pool resources to research greater technologies, create factories to pump out material to feed your nation or trade with others, develop laws and policies to manage citizens and resources, and most importantly, move as one to go to war!

## Towns and Nations
Using the States mod Project Towny has an inbuilt land claim system focused on creating towns and nations. Each town can claim chunks for their own, with the specific limit being based around both its population and wealth. Citizens of a town work together to develop the town's research, unlocking more advanced tech as the town or nation progresses.

What’s more, land is closely tied to resources, as well. The Geolosys mod vastly changes how the underground looks. Ores are tightly concentrated into deposits that must be sought out by scouring the surface for valuable resources. No longer can you simply strip mine through the underground, spending hours to get enough steel for the first machine. Infinite water sources also are no longer infinite, instead only being infinitely harvestable from rivers and oceans. Guard your territory fiercely and harvest it for all it’s worth!

## Research
What truly makes Project Towny unique is its research system. Gamestages aren’t a new concept, of course, but no other modpack makes them quite so collaborative.

In Project Towny, you can fund various research stages of your choice using money gained by selling off your hard-earned resources and products through the bounty board. Technology also plays a part with members of a town having to collaborate to create the needed items to progress to the next tech. Work as a community to fulfill orders and progress through the game, unlocking more advanced technologies as you go.

## Grow and Expand
There are quite a lot of large custom machines utilized in the later game, and you’ll want a town to construct it with. The distances between you, ores, and other nations also encourages the construction of transportation projects. Many different blocks now give you minor speed boosts, and mods like immersive vehicles and immersive railroading ensure that you’ll never have a lack of ways to move from point A to point B.

## Colonize the Stars
With the release of v0.6 we’ve fleshed out the space stage. Dive into Advanced Rocketry in order to explore other planets, send missions to the asteroid belt, and come back with all the sweet, sweet science to show for it. With a completely reworked, more realistic Advanced Rocketry progression, you'll be launching satellites before stepping foot on the moon! Launch satellites to collect data, collect surface samples from the moon, build a space station to perform microgravity required science experiments, mine ores only found on asteroids, and explore the vast custom solar system, featuring many unique planets with unique and realistic characteristics.

## Destroy the World!
You can’t own the whole world, but you can own everything that’s left when you blow the rest up. ICBM technology is quite effective at doing so, of course, but our particular poison is Pollution of the Realms. A little pollution is always going to happen, that’s unavoidable. However, be careful not to burn too much oil at once, lest the sky turn yellow and even a diamond respirator only lets you survive for thirty seconds on a full filter.

However, pollution’s been decreased by a lot nonetheless, so diesel and gas power is reasonable, and flying a plane doesn’t carve a swath of destruction in its wake. Mostly. It’s a very small swath. Remember, Carbon will naturally decay as it fertilizes plants, but sulfur stays in the atmosphere, so be very careful about producing too much of it with no filter. Also, methane exists and coal explodes. Play our modpack!

## Official Server
Project Towny has an official server we're currently running to beta test numerous features. Come join our Discord (click the button above) for information about the server and modpack as a whole. I'm sure there's a town that would love to have you!
